# About KAPsNotes

KAPsNotes are notes made by Kapil Sharma (me) for personal reference. Right from the school days, making self study notes was one of my major strengths. During those days, my friends frequently borrow my note books for copying the notes.

Even now, when I am a professional, I continues to make notes of all the new subject I study. Recently I decided to make my notes in the form of book. Purpose is still personal, carrying notebooks is not easy but pdf books can be easily carried in my tablet. However with notes in soft copy, I decided to make them public in case it help someone. I generally make two types of notes:

* Detailed notes while studying a subject and
* Quick references. Earlier during school/college days, they were supposed to be revised before exam. Now they are quick reference which I keep handy to refer whenever needed.

This book is the quick reference of Git.

Please note, this is not a full book. Please refer free book 'Pro-git' for details. This book is supposed to be quick reference guide and helpful once you know basics of Git but need quick reference of few commands.
